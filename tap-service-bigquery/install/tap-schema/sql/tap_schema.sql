tapdata.allwise	w4m	\N	\N	----	Integer frame coverage. This column gives the number of individual 8.8s W4  exposures on which a profile-fit measurement of this source was possible.   This number can differ between the four bands because band-dependent  criteria are used to select individual frames for inclusion in the coadded  Atlas Images.

tapdata.allwise	tmass_key	\N	\N	----	2MASS PSC association. Unique identifier of the closest source in the 2MASS  Point Source Catalog (PSC) that falls within 3 of the non-motion fit  position of this WISE source. This is equivalent to the pts_key in the  2MASS PSC entry. This column is null if there is no 2MASS PSC source  within 3 of the WISE source position. The number of 2MASS PSC sources  within 3 of the WISE position is given in *n_2mass*   *CAUTION* - 2MASS source information included in the WISE source record is  an *association* not an *identification*. Although the position accuracies  of the two Catalogs are good, there is a non-zero probability of chance  associations between physically unrelated objects, as well as missed  associations between the Catalogs. You should always confirm associations  by reviewing the entries from both Catalogs.	int	\N	\N	\N	1	0	1	285	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	w4nm	\N	\N	----	Integer frame detection count. This column gives the number of individual  8.8s exposures on which this source was detected with SNR>3 in the W4  profile-fit measurement. This number can be zero for sources that are  well-detected on the coadded Atlas Image, but too faint for detection on  the single exposures.	int	\N	\N	\N	1	0	1	69	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	w2cc_map	\N	\N	----	Contamination and confusion map for this source in W2. This column contains  the integer equivalent of the 9-bit binary number that specifies if the W2  measurement is believed to be contaminated by or a spurious detection of an  image artifact. The elements of the binary array are: [TABLE]   The leftmost bit, S, differentiates whether the band-detection is believed  to be a real detection contaminated by an artifact (0) or a spurious  detection of an artifact (1). The remaining bits are set to 1 to denote  contamination by different types of artifacts according to the letters:     - *D* - Diffraction spike. Source may be a spurious detection of or     contaminated by a diffraction spike a nearby bright star on the same     image.    - *P* - Persistence. Source may be a spurious detection of or     contaminated by a short-term latent (persistence) image left by a bright     source.    - *H* - Halo. Source may be a spurious detection of or contaminated by     the scattered light halo associated with a bright star.    - *O (letter o)* - Optical ghost. Source may be a spurious detection     of or contaminated by an optical ghost image caused by a nearby bright     source on the same image.  For example, a measurement that is believed to be a spurious detection of a  diffraction spike and scattered light halo has a binary bit map value of  100001001 and *w2cc_map=265*.	int	\N	\N	\N	1	0	1	77	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	cntr	\N	\N	----	Unique identification number for this object in the AllWISE Catalog/Reject  Table. This number is formed from the source_id, which is in turn formed  from the coadd_id and source number, src.   The *cntr* value is formed by making the source_id into an integer, in the  format: *RRRRsDDDtrevIIIIII*, where     - *RRRR* = Tile center RA in deci-degrees, truncated not rounded (*e.g.     RRRR=int[10*ra]*), as in the coadd_id.    - *s* = Tile center Declination sign translated from p or m into 1     or 0, respectively.    - *DDD* = Tile center Declination in deci-degrees, as in the coadd_id.     For positive declinations, the tenths of a degree is truncated not rounded (*e.g.     DDD=int[10*dec]*). For negative declinations, the tenths of a degree is     always truncated leftward on the number line (*e.g. DDD=ceil[10*abs(dec)*    ].    - *[trev]* = Disambiguation string, translated where necessary into     digits corresponding to the letters places in the alphabet.        - *t* - Tile type translated into two digits, zero-filled (a =        01).       - *r* - Data Release identifier translated into a single digit, (For        AllWISE: c = 3).       - *e* - Survey Phase (5 = AllWISE [Full cryogenic + 3-Band Cryo +        Post-Cryo]).       - *v* - Processing version.        The translated disambiguation string is always *01351* for AllWISE.    - *IIIIII* = six-digit, zero-filled, sequential extracted source number,     src, within the Tile.  For example, a source in the Tile *3041m137_ac51*, with a source_id of  *3041m137_ac51-012345*, has a *cntr* value of *3041013701351012345*.  *NOTE:* AllWISE Catalog and Reject Table entries are cross-referenced with  the Multiepoch Photometry (MEP) Database via the *cntr* identifier. The  Catalog/Reject Table *cntr* value is referred to as *cntr_mf* in the MEP  Database.	int	\N	\N	\N	1	0	1	13	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Source may be a spurious detection     of or contaminated by an optical ghost image caused by a nearby bright     source on the same image.  For example, a measurement that is believed to be a spurious detection of a  diffraction spike and scattered light halo has a binary bit map value of  100001001 and *w1cc_map=265*.	int	\N	\N	\N	1	0	1	75	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

The value is -log10(Q2(rho12)),  where Q2 is the two-tailed fraction of all cases expected to show at least  this much apparent positive or negative correlation when in fact there is  no correlation. The value is clipped at 9.   When the number of measurements is large, the significance of correlation  also tends to be large even though the correlations themselves may have a  small magnitude.

This is a typical manifestation of statistical  significance increasing as the sample size increases; eventually the  significant effect can be due to small correlated errors in background  estimation or even roundoff errors.

The identifier has  the general form: *RRRRsDDD_[trev]*, where         - *RRRR* = Tile center RA in deci-degrees, truncated not rounded (*e.g.     RRRR=int[10*ra]*).    - *s* = Tile center Declination sign (p=+, m=-)    - *DDD* = Tile center Declination in deci-degrees. For positive     declinations, the tenths of a degree is truncated not rounded (*e.g.     DDD=int[10*dec]*). For negative declinations, the tenths of a degree is     always truncated leftward on the number line (*e.g. DDD=ceil[10*abs(dec)*    ].    - *[trev]* = Disambiguation string.        - *t* - Tile type (a = Atlas)       - *r* - Data Release (c = AllWISE)       - *e* - Survey Phase (5 = AllWISE [Full Cryogenic + 3-Band Cryo +        Post-Cryo])       - *v* - Processing version.        The disambiguation string is always *ac51* for Tiles in the AllWISE     Release products.     For example, the identifier of the AllWISE Atlas Tile with center at (α,δ =  304.13896,-13.63000) is *3041m137_ac51*.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	15	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	ph_qual	\N	\N	----	Photometric quality flag. Four character flag, one character per band  [W1/W2/W3/W4], that provides a shorthand summary of the quality of the  profile-fit photometry measurement in each band, as derived from the  measurement signal-to-noise ratio.     - *A* - Source is detected in this band with a flux signal-to-noise     ratio *w?snr>10*.    - *B* - Source is detected in this band with a flux signal-to-noise     ratio	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	60	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	w2cc_map_str	\N	\N	----	Contamination and confusion string. This column is a character string that  denotes all artifacts that may contaminate the W2 measurement of this  source, in the priority order *D,P,H,O,d,p,h,o*. Lower-case letters denote  cases where the source detection in this band is believed to be real but  the measurement may be contaminated by the artifact. Upper-case letters  denote cases where the source detection in this band may be a spurious  detection of an artifact.  For example, a real detection that is contaminated by a diffraction spike  and a latent (persistent) image has a *w2cc_map_str=dp*. A spurious  detection of a diffraction spike that is also contaminated by a latent  image has *w2cc_map_str=Dp*.  This string is null if there are no artifacts that affect the measurement  in this band.  The value that appears in second element of the *cc_flags* string is the  left-most character in *w2cc_map_str*. If *w2cc_map_str* is null, then  the corresponding cc_flags entry is 0.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	78	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	designation	\N	\N	----	Sexagesimal, equatorial position-based source name in the form:  *hhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s*. The full naming convention for AllWISE Source Catalog  sources has the form *WISEA  Jhhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s*, where *WISEA*  indicates the source is from the AllWISE Source Catalog, and *J*  indicates the position is J2000. The *WISEA* acronym is not listed  explicitly in the *designation* column.   The acronym for entries in the AllWISE Reject Table is *WISEAR*.  *CAUTION:* Source designations should not be used as an astrometric  reference. They are not a substitute for the source position information in  the ra and dec columns.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

tapdata.allwise	rel	\N	\N	----	Small-separation, same-Tile (SSST) detection flag. Non-null values of this  flag indicate that this Catalog/Reject Table entry is part of a group of  detections with unphysically small separations that were extracted on the  same Tile. SSST groups occurred when a faint, often spurious noise  detection was shifted towards the position of a brighter nearby source  during the chi-squared minimization profile-fit source extraction process.  This resulted in two or more extractions on the same Tile that have nearly  the same position and similar fluxes. SSST groups were identified and  classified using the *rel* flag, and the classifications are used as part  of Catalog source selection. The possible values of the *rel* column are:     - *null -* The extraction is not part of a SSST group, and is eligible     for the AllWISE Catalog.    - *s -* The extraction is part of an SSST group, and is the original,     correct extraction that is eligible for the AllWISE Catalog.    - *c -* The extraction is part of an SSST group amd is the original,     correct extraction, but is inadvertantly flagged as a spurious artifact. It     is eligible for inclusion in the AllWISE Catalog.    - *r -* The extraction is part of an SSST group, but is the least     reliable extraction in the group. It is not eligible for the Catalog. These     are found only in the AllWISE Reject Table.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	57	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	w4cc_map_str	\N	\N	----	Contamination and confusion string. This column is a character string that  denotes all artifacts that may contaminate the W4 measurement of this  source, in the priority order *D,P,H,O,d,p,h,o*. Lower-case letters denote  cases where the source detection in this band is believed to be real but  the measurement may be contaminated by the artifact. Upper-case letters  denote cases where the source detection in this band may be a spurious  detection of an artifact.   For example, a real detection that is contaminated by a diffraction spike  and a latent (persistent) image has a *w4cc_map_str=dp*. A spurious  detection of a diffraction spike that is also contaminated by a latent  image has *w4cc_map_str=Dp*.  This string is null if there are no artifacts that affect the measurement  in this band.  The value that appears in first element of the *cc_flags* string is the  fourth character in *w4cc_map_str*. If *w4cc_map_str* is null, then the  corresponding cc_flags entry is 0.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	82	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	cc_flags	\N	\N	----	Contamination and confusion flag. Four character string, one character per  band [W1/W2/W3/W4], that indicates that the photometry and/or position  measurements of a source may be contaminated or biased due to proximity to  an image artifact. The type of artifact that may contaminate the  measurements is denoted by the following codes. Lower-case letters  correspond to instances in which the source detection in a band is believed  to be real but the measurement may be contaminated by the artifact.  Upper-case letters are instances in which the source detection in a band  may be a spurious detection of an artifact.         - *D,d* - Diffraction spike. Source may be a spurious detection of (*D*)     or contaminated by (*d*) a diffraction spike from a nearby bright star     on the same image, or    - *P,p* - Persistence. Source may be a spurious detection of (*P*) or     contaminated by (*p*) a short-term latent image left by a bright source,     or    - *H,h* - Halo. Source may be a spurious detection of (*H*) or     contaminated by (*h*) the scattered light halo surrounding a nearby     bright source, or    - *O,o (letter o)* - Optical ghost. Source may be a spurious detection     of (*O*) or contaminated by (o) an optical ghost image caused by a     nearby bright source, or    - *0 (number zero)* - Source is unaffected by known artifacts.  A source extraction may be affected by more than one type of artifact or  condition. In this event, the *cc_flags* value in each band is set in the  following priority order: *D,P,H,O,d,p,h,o,0*. The full tally of artifacts  affecting a source in each band is given in the w?cc_map and w?cc_map_str  columns.  A source can appear in the AllWISE Source Catalog even if it is flagged as  a spurious artifact detection in a band if there is a reliable detection in  another band that is not flagged as a spurious artifact detection (see V.3.b).  Entries in the AllWISE Reject Table may be flagged as spurious detections  of artifacts in all bands.  *CAUTION:* Non-zero *cc_flags* values in any band indicate the the  measurement in that band may be contaminated and the photometry should be  used with caution.	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	56	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
tapdata.allwise	var_flg	\N	\N	----	Variability flag. The variability flag is a four-character string, one  character per band, in which the value for each band is related to the  probability that the source flux measured on the individual WISE exposures  was not constant with time. The probability calculation uses the standard  deviation of the single exposure flux measurements, *w?sigp1*, as well as  the band-to-band flux correlation significance, *q12,q23,q34*.   The probability is computed for a band only when there are at least six  single-exposure measurements available that satisfy minimum quality criteria.  A value of n in a band indicates insufficient or inadequate data to make  a determination of possible variability. Values of 0 through 9 indicate  increasing probabilities of variation. Values of 0 through 5 are most  likely not variables. Sources with values of 6 and 7 are likely flux  variables, but are the most susceptible to false-positive variability.  *Var_flg* values greater than 7 have the highest probability of being  true flux variables in a band.  *CAUTION:* Estimation of flux variability is unreliable for sources that  are extended (*ext_flg>0*), and sources whose measurements are contaminated  by image artifacts in a band (*cc_flags[b] != 0*).	char	*	\N	\N	1	0	1	59	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
